    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chocolate milk is easy to make at home from scratch, and you don't need a bottle of chocolate syrup. This recipe
        is made with real cocoa powder and just a little sugar for sweetness. Both kids and adults are going to love its
        taste.</p>
    <p>Every aspect of this recipe can be customized. For instance, use your favorite type of milk, whether it's dairy
        or an alternative like almond or soy milk. By using unsweetened cocoa powder, you can adjust the sweetness to
        taste with more or less sugar.</p>

    <p>It's also easy to scale it up for a big, ready-to-drink batch in the fridge. You can even warm it up for hot
        cocoa or add a little extra flavor. </p>

        <li>Pour the milk into a glass and slowly add cocoa powder while blending with an immersion blender, spoon, or a
            small whisk. An immersion blender or a small whisk work best because they reduce the clumping of the cocoa
            powder.</li>
